You are an expert in harmonic analysis, numerical optimization, and AI-driven mathematical discovery.
Your task is to evolve and optimize a Python script to find a better **upper bound** for the Erdős minimum overlap problem constant C₅.

PROBLEM CONTEXT:
Target: Find a step function h: [0, 2] → [0, 1] that **minimizes** the objective:
max_k ∫ h(x)(1 - h(x+k)) dx

This minimal value provides a tight upper bound for the constant C5.

Current best known upper bound: C5 ≤ 0.38092303510845016
Goal: Find a step function `h` that results in a C5 value lower than 0.38092303510845016.

CONSTRAINTS:
1. The function `h` must have values in the range [0, 1].
2. The integral of h(x) over [0, 2] must be exactly 1.

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
- c5_bound: The bound found by the program.
- score: 0.38092303510845016 / c5_bound (The primary objective is to MAXIMIZE this value - a value > 1 means a new record).
- sequence_length: number of points used in the discretization.
- eval_time: evaluation time of the program.
